# Processing
Generative scripts built usings Processing


# Quick Guide
There are two files within this repo 'functions' and 'coder_x pieces', as you can probably guess, functions contains a set of definitions (such as 'draw a gradient toned circle') that are then called inside code pieces.

Generally, I've tried to be helpful and include docstrings inside the function definitions. Because of the setup of processing, you won't be able to run these scripts from scratch on pulling this repo. The code pieces need to be in a folder (with the same name as themselves) alongside the relevant functions. After this, they should be fine to run in Processing.


## Functions
    - **squiggle.pde** *draws a perlin noise affected line based*
    - **anotherSquiggle.pde** *as above, but perlin is a function of x and y rather than line distance*
    - **gradientCircle.pde** *draws a circle with the color affected by noise*
    - **donut.pde** *as above, but with a centre-gap*
    - **gradientRect.pde** *draws a rectable with the color affected by noise*
    - **griadentTriangle.pde** *you probably get it by now*
    - **haze.pde** *creates a fill of a colour with varying transparancy*
    - **squareGlyph.pde** *creates 'glyph' out of sections of a square*
